# IrisSpecies-Logistic-Regression
A machine learning project implementing multiclass classification to identify iris flower species based on their physical measurements. This project demonstrates the complete ML pipeline from data exploration to model evaluation, achieving 100% accuracy on the test set.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project uses logistic regression to classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on four physical features:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width

The project showcases fundamental machine learning concepts including data visualization, train-test splitting, model training, and comprehensive evaluation metrics.
